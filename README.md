# minecraft-handmade-headless-client
A minecraft client that I hand made, still WIP and only .get_status() is working fully.<br/>
1.18.2 offline is the main focus for now
<br/><h2>WARNING</h2> This currently only works on offline servers as there is no encrytion reqest detection or responce, would like if someone would add (should still work on offline servers though!)
<br/>main file is Server_api.py
<br/>For: 1.18.2 and 1.19.2 java (no others tested, but new ones can get added easly)
<br/>Todo: 
<br/>&emsp;make online_login
<br/>&emsp;test and fix honeypot
